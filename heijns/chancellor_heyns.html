        "He came like a gift of heaven to leadership of the Berkeley
campus.  He was an ambassador of good will when so many others were
expressing ill will."  So stated President Emeritus Clark Kerr in 1995
when news came of the death of Roger Heyns in Volos, Greece on September
11th.

<p>

        With an A.B. (1940) from <a target="_top" 
href="http://www.calvin.edu/">Calvin College</a> and both M.A. (1942) and
Ph.D. in psychology (1949) from the <a target="_top" 
href="http://www.umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>, Roger Heyns
joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1947, received the
Outstanding Teaching Award in 1952, and the Faculty Distinguished Service
Award in 1958.  When he was called to the Berkeley Chancellorship in 1965
he was serving as Vice President of the University of Michigan. 

<p>

        In an oral history interview which he completed in 1986, Heyns
recalled of his coming to Berkeley:  "I think I came because of the
opportunities that Berkeley provided.  I also recognized that the problems
they were facing were real."  During his eight years at the helm, he began
the special minority admissions program and saw to successful conclusion
major building projects that had been planned before his incumbency: the
Lawrence Hall of Science, honoring the Berkeley career of Ernest Orlando
Lawrence, and the University Art Museum, made possible in part by the gift
of many of his paintings by Hans Hofmann, a German emigr&eacute;e who had
been welcomed to the Berkeley campus in 1933. 

<p>

        Roger Heyns and his wife Esther moved into the long-vacant
University House, and became the first Chancellor to live on the campus.
His associate Earl Cheit noted that "Roger thought he ought to be in the
center of things."  His outreach extended not on ly to the students but to
the people of the state of California;  he spoke to groups up and down the
state and established the Robert Gordon Sproul Associates to recognize
major donors to the campus.  Both <a target="_top" 
href="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MOFF/">Moffitt Undergraduate 
Library</a> and the Space Sciences Laboratory opened during his tenure.

<p>

        Upon leaving the University in 1971 he became president of the
American Council on Education, and from 1977 to 1993 directed the
Hewlett-Packard Foundation in Palo Alto.
