<B>My Trip to The Netherlands, July, 1929</B><br>

<B>July 21:</B> Started from Grand Rapids at 1:45 p.m., Sunday. Arrived in
Perrysburg, Ohio (near Toledo) at 7:30 p.m. and registered at the
Perrysburg Hotel.<br><br>
<B>July 22:</B> Started from Perrysburg Hotel at 4:00 a.m. Traveled thru Ohio
and Pennsylvania to Grand View Point, PA. and stayed in the Grand View
Hotel that night. The roads were very hilly and it was dangerous
driving, but the scenery was beautiful. Passed over the highest peaks in
the East - Mount Bald Knob, 2,906 ft. In the morning we saw a wonderful
sight - a fog, or really a cloud, in the valley below us. We were really
above the clouds.<br><br>
<B>July 23:</B> Started from Grand View Hotel at 7:30 a.m. Drove thru the
mountains and got a view of 50 miles of country. Had to climb and go
down grades 5 miles long. Arrived at Uncle Gerrit's place at 3:30 p.m.
It is near Pheonixville, PA. Am having a dandy time with the 10
children.<br><br>
<B>July 25:</B> Started from Uncle Gerrit's at 4:30 p.m. Arrived at Uncle
John's house in Murray Hill, NJ at 9:30 p.m. Watched Cor graft rose
buds. Climbed up the water tower and took pictures of the surrounding
neighborhood.<br><br>
<B>July 26:</B> Started from Uncle John's at 7:30 a.m. Drove thru the Holland
Tunnel under the Hudson River. Arrived at the boat dock (pier) at
Hoboken, NJ at 10:00 a.m. Had car (1928 Nash 4 Dr., Dual Ignition)
washed, and Dad drove to the dock at 1:00 p.m. Took picture of car being
lifted aboard by deck crane. Waited in nearby park and boarded ship
after supper at 8:15 p.m. Spent time before sailing looking over ship
and cabins (S.S. New Amsterdam, Captain: J. K. Lieuwen). Departed dock
at 12:15 a.m. Sailed past New York loop and Statue of Liberty and turned
in at 1:00 a.m.<br><br>
<B>July 27:</B> Got up at 6:30 a.m. Saw 7 ships during the day. Ate breakfast
at 8:00 a.m. Saw a whale spout in the morning. Ate lunch at 1:00 p.m.
Played Shuffle Board in the afternoon. Ate dinner at 7:00 p.m. Went to
bed at 9:30 p.m. after taking a salt water bath. Slept fine that night.<br><br>
<B>July 28:</B> Got up at 7:00 a.m. Saw a school of Dolphins off
starboard (1/2 mile away) before breakfast. Saw another school off port
after lunch, only about 50 yds away. One of the fish raced the ship, but
gave up. Entered and lost in a shuffle board tournament. Saw only one
ship, a freighter during the day. The sea was a little rougher in the
evening than before. Turned in at 10:20 p.m.<br><br> 
<B>July 29:</B> Got up at 7:15 a.m. Played deck tennis for the first time;
shuffle board in the afternoon. After supper (at 8:30 p.m.) watched a
movie which was pretty good. Didn't see either ships or fish during the
whole day. At 8:30 p.m. saw a light, probably a ship, but that was all.
Turned in at 10:35 p.m.<br><br>
<B>July 30:</B> Got up at 8:00 a.m. Played deck tennis and shuffle board. Saw
about 50 flying fish during the day. They were silver colored and about
6 inches long. they glided about 20 yards and sometimes went 5 feet
high. It was fun to see them. Didn't see any ships at all today. We were
going east, but we turned northeast today. Had fun in the dining room
before going to bed. Was introduced to "Doggie" today.<br><br>

<B>July 31:</B> Got up at 7:45 a.m. Saw a square-rigger in full flight. Slept a
while after lunch. Passed thru a fog before dinner. The ship's horn blew
a few seconds every minute for about an hour. Went thru the First Class
and up to the bow of the ship before dinner. saw some interesting
things. Had a dance on the second deck at 9:00 p.m. heard that this ship
uses about 400 carloads of coal every trip. There are 18 stokers at work
all the time. They earn only $40 a month. Stewards receive only $24 and
some only $19 a month. I know of a few men who are working their way
across and they don't get anything. The stewards say that their meals
and sleeping quarters are poor, but the passengers are handled better on
this line than on any other. We get dandy meals and service. Turned in
at 12:00 a.m.<br><br>
<B>Aug 1:</B> Got up at 8:30 a.m. Went thru the whole ship today. First, I went
to the engine room and saw all the hugh machinery. The propeller shaft
is about 100 feet long and 1 1/2 ft. in diameter, made of solid steel.
Saw the water pumps and the big cylinders which drive the propellers.
Each shaft (2) is driven by four connecting rods. it is very hot in the
engine room and by the stokers in the boiler room, it is about 120
degrees. There are four rows of boiler furnaces and there are forty-two
fire holes in all, that eat 2,000 tons of coal every trip across. Went
thru the steward's and crew's quarters, which are not very good as to
room and fresh air. Went to bow of ship from which wonderful sights can
be seen. Went to the wheel-house and got chase out, but we saw how the
ship is steered. Played in a deck tennis tournament with "Doggie" and
lost. Saw a show called "Tenderloin" after dinner which was pretty good.
Went to the bow and saw a most wonderful sight after dark. it is the
phosphorous in the water at the bow. It is just like there is a big
electric light shining thru the water. it is caused by sea animals which
are phosphorescent. We could see them try to dart away from the ship
because of their glow. It was just wonderful. Went to the First Class
Masquerade Ball and saw some good costumes. We saw 3 ships during the
day. a tanker, a four masted schooner and the three-stack Red Star
liner, "Belgeland". We also saw some porpoises in the afternoon. I guess
I saw enough sights for one day. Turned in at 12:30 a.m.<br><br>
<B>Aug 2:</B> Got up at 8:00 a.m. The weather was pretty cold, so we
weren't outside much. Saw a school of porpoises this morning, but no
ships. It was foggy nearly all day. Watched the horse races in the
smoking room 'til 11:30 p.m. Turned in at 11:45 p.m.<br><br>

<B>Aug 3:</B> Up at 8:00 a.m. Passed a freighter after breakfast. Went to the
bow and took pictures of it and the Bridge. Had a haircut after lunch
and bought my ring. Had a Tug-of-War with other men on two sides and
won. Saw a Ladies Tug-of-War. Watched and was in a dandy Pillow-fight
tournament (I lost) in which you sit on a pole and try to knock each
other off. The last two to fight were nearly tied. One was called U.S.A.
and the other Holland. U.S.A. won. Saw a good show in swhich Rin-Tin-Tin
starred. It was the "Land of the Wolves". Turned in at 11:00 p.m. in
order to be up at 6:00 a.m. to see my first sight of land (the English
coast) after seven days of travel at sea. Just saw lights of what seems
to be three ships. Shows we are near a coast. They may have been
light-houses or bouys.<br><br>
<B>Aug 4:</B> Up at 6:30 a.m. Saw the ship enter Plymouth Harbor and the Pilot
get on and the ship-shore boat take passengers away. Took many picutres
of this. After leaving Plymouth we saw about 50 ships until we arrived
at Boulonge-Le-Mer and land nearly all the way. I had my first sight of
land for eight days, this morning. Sea-gulls followed us all day.
Arrived at Boulonge about 11:00 p.m. Saw many pretty sights today. Saw a
few porpoises. Turned in at 12:35 p.m.<br><br>
<B>Aug 5:</B> Up at 11:00 a.m. Saw many ships. Saw the pilot board the
ship before the Hook-of-Holland. Had a beautiful trip from there to
Rotterdam. Saw many wonderful sights along this trip, scenery and ships,
etc. Landed at the pier at 6:00p.m. Aunts Jo, Neeltje, Woutrien and Opa
Kersbergen met us at the boat. We waited about an hour and a half for
the car and then drove to Waddingsveen. Went to Uncle Leen Verstoep a
while. Slept at Aunt Neeltje's tonite.<br><br>
<B>August 6:</B> Up at 9:00 a.m. Father
and Mother came and got me and we went to Aunt Woutrien's and Opa
Kersbergen and a Juffrow and drove to Sandvoort to my Aunt's summer
home. Met her two little girls. They are both cute. Had a nice time on
the beach of the North Sea. It was a little cold on the beach. Started
for home about 5:00 p.m. The Juffrow who rode along became auto-sick
because she couldn't stand it to ride in an automobile. Got along with
my Dutch fairly well for the first day, but I had a lot to learn yet.
Went to bed at Aunt Neeltje's at 10:00 p.m.<br><br>
<B>August 7:</B> Up at 9:30 a.m.
Went riding in the afternoon to Aunt Jo's house and the "Tweede Block"
and rode the bicycle to Great Grandmother's house in the morning. Was at
Opoe's (Grandma's) while they opened the big trunk. Watched the small
freight boats go up and down the Gouwa River and the draw bridge go up
and down to let them thru. It is a nice sight to see. Had fun in a
flat-bottomed boat with Wm. Ramp. He had a broken leg.<br><br>
<B>Aug. 8:</B> Went to the Gouda market this morning with uncle Dries. Had a
dandy time. We rode to Gouda on our bicycles. Gouda is about five miles
from Waddingsveen. Saw the different Jews, etc. (merchants) trying to
sell their wares  which run from teeth-extractors to umbrellas. Sat in a
cafe in front of the market place and had a drink. Saw the old Stathuis
(city hall). Went swimming in the Waddingsveen swimming pool. It is a
pretty good affair. They have good high-diving boards and everything.
The men all wear suits without shirts and they thought my suit was
peculiar because it had a top.<br><br>

<B>August 9:</B> My Uncle Cor had a birthday today, so we had dinner at his
house. Went and saw his nursery. Bought a fish line and went fishing in
canal nearby but caught nothing.<br><br>

<!--Page 4-->
<HR size=1><br>

Had tea in the nursery, same as we have a picnic. Went back to
Waddingsveen on a passenger boat from Boskoop. Went to Aunt Neeltje's
and played with the girl cousins. The oldest is 12. Went rowing in an
old affair that was supposed to be a row-boat, but we had a lot of fun.
I sleep at Aunt Neeltje's all the time now and eat most of my meals here
and I like the place because there is some life in it.<br><br>
<B>Aug. 10:</B> Went fishing some more but had no luck again. Have fun riding
one of my Uncle's bikes around. Helped him deliver some groceries. Went
swimming again after that. Saw a water-ball game. it is something like
hockey only in the water and with a ball. When I came back I heard there
had been a murder. That was quite something for a village like this and
everyone knew about it within an hour. The murderer was brought to the
county office and jail soon afterwards. In about 5 minutes the whole
village was there to see him. There was a crowd around most of the
night.<br><br>
<B>Aug. 11:</B> Went to the old Dutch church of my Grandmother this Sunday
morning. You have to rent your seats (pews) for the year so i sat
upstairs. Went for a walk after dinner with Oma. Everyone was talking
about the murder wherever you went. It seems that a man (who happens to
have the same last name and first initial as my uncle) killed another
man by the name of Schotman with an old-fashioned razor because of a
quarrel over a hedge that stood between their houses. Schotman's head
was nearly cut off, and he was attacked from behind, in front of his
house. He had been warned to look out. There was a mob at the County
Building again all day today.<br><br>
<B>Aug. 12:</B> Didn't do much today. Went fishing without any luck and played
around the village's main street and watched the sights go by, such 
as people and boats, etc. Ate supper at Opoe's house tonight. Had
pancakes. Am catching up my Diary which i had let get a week behind.
Have to write a few letters yet and then will go to bed. Mother and
Father got Mrs. Buker, a family friend, off the boat yesterday and took
her to Amsterdam. They slept at Opa Kersbergen's last night.<br><br>
<B>Aug. 13:</B> Up at 8:30 a.m. The murderer was taken to Rotterdam at 7:00
a.m. this morning to be tried. He won't get more than 15 years becuse
they have no death or life sentences in Holland. Fixed an old bicycle
for the kids next door. Took a picture of all the kids in the
neighborhood. Will sell them for 10 cents.<br><br>
<B>Aug. 14:</B> Up at 9:00 a.m. Got the pictures back this noon and sold about
ten of them. Learned how to put a farmer's wagon togehter because I
first took it apart. We're going to Noordwijk tomorrow.<br><br>
<B>Aug. 15:</B> Got up at 7:30 a.m. (early?). Took a picture of a ship this
morning and the skipper wants 6 of them for 10 cents each. Went to
Noordwijk on a big bus which we had hired for the day, at 9:30 a.m.
Rented six beach-chairs. Ate dinner. Went swimming in the North Sea
(salt water and do I know it.) Went after sea shells later and got my
pants soaked by a big wave. Had a dandy time. Went back in the bus at
6:30 p.m. Got to Waddingsveen at 8:30 p.m. Turned in at 10:00 p.m.
(There were 21 persons in our party).<br><br>

<HR size=1><br>

<B>Aug 16:</B> Had fun with the kids next door. Didn't do much else today. Went
for a walk with Toosie (14) who lives next door to Aunt Neeltje.<br><br>
<B>August 17:</B> Up at 8:00 a.m. Waited all morning for Mother and Father to come to
go to Sandvoort. They came about 12:30 p.m. Had dinner here. We left
about 1:30 p.m. and arrived in Sandvoort at 4:00 p.m. Took a wak thru
the sand dunes and the town with Artje. Got Uncle Jack at the train. He
is a doctor and has cured many people who were thought to be incurable.
He is now helping Dad with his asthsma. Walked along the sea-shore in
the wind in the evening.<br><br>
<B>Aug. 19:</B>  Up at 8:30 a.m.  Bought a pair of beach shoes and a
kite.  Went to the beach early in the morning.  flew my kite and
went wading in the ocean.  stayed on the beach until the tide came in
and surrounded the chairs with water in the trench we had dug.  That
was about 3:30 p.m.  Ate dinner and started for Boskoop.  First went
to Grandma's.  Played with a gang of kids from the neighborhood for a
while.  Then to Aunt Neeltje's and to bed.<br><br>
<B>Aug. 20:</B>  Up at 7:00 a.m.  At 8:00 Mother and Father came and
we left for Arnheim with Aunt Neeltje and Uncle Dries.  It was the
first time Uncle Dries rode in our car and he liked it.  At 10:00 we
stopped at a lunch room and had our breakfast.  Went thru Utrecht. 
Between Ede and Arnheim we rode on a real American cement road and dit
it feel good!  Arrived at Arnheim at 11:30 a.m.  First, we went to a
museum in which all reliques of the Dutch Indies War were kept, and the
Soldiers Home.  Saw all the old guns used in that time, canons,
mortars, muskets, revolvers, etc.  Also waw the spears, armour, etc.
of the tribes of the Indies and of the people of China.  Saw many
other interesting things there.  Next we went to an Estate of a Dutch
Baron.  A caretaker took a group of people thru free.  The scenery
was wonderful.  We had to cross over a chain bridge and we had to run
all the way to get over without slipping.  We also walked around a
fountain, but all at once about fifty smaller fountians started to spout
around about us.  Some people got all wet (A trick).  Saw the
Baron's castle and the exit used in time of war.  Saw the wonderful
shell gallery.  It is a gallery in the side of a hill whose walls are
all inlaid with wonderful shells.  Went back to Arnheim and had dinner
in a cafe.  We then went to the Animal Park a little ways outside of
Arnheim.  The park alone was worth the trip to Arnheim.  We saw many
different and rare kinds of animals and birds, such as black and white
storks, swan, parrots, buzzards, sea-ariends, vultures, wolves, wild
boars monkeys, mountain goats and sheep who climbed up high rocks that
were made for them, tigers, lions, leopards, camels (one only 7 months
old), and an elephant and baboons.  It was a dandy park and it was fun
to see the different animals play together.  We spent about an haur
and half there.  Started home at 7:00 p.m.  Arrived at 10:00 p.m. 
Traveled about 250 kilometers or 150 miles.  Forgot to say that near
Ede we saw about 150 Dutch soldiers carrying on war practice, on the
road, with all kinds of canons, tractor guns and everything just like a
real war.  One side were the Hollanders.  The enemy had white bands
around their hats to distinguish them.  The privates had to salute
every officer.  Every once in a while a dispatcher on a  motorcycle
would fly past us.  The soldiers moved from one place to another on
foot, bicycles and in autos.  Some of the soldiers were laying in the
fields and everything was carried on like there was a real war.  It
was all very interesting to see.<br><br>
<B>Aug. 21:</B>  Up at 10:00 a.m.  The kids are all going to school, for
their vacation was over on Tuesday (yesterday).  They have only 4
weeks of vacation here.  Helped Undle Dries deliver groceries this
noon.  Tried to fly my kite at Aunt Belia's, but there wasn't enough
wind, so I played wome games with my cousins and others 'til 9:00 p.m.<br><br>

<!--Page 6-->
<HR size=1><br>

<B>Aug. 22:</B>  It was raining this morning, so I wrote some letters and
postcards.  Mrs. Buker came from Amsterdam today.  she took the bus
to Boskoop where Father and Mother are staying.  They arrived here
just after she left, so they had to go back to Boskoop again.  Turned
in at 11:00 p.m.<br><br>
<B>Aug. 23:</B>  Rained again today.  Yesterday we had our first bad
weather in Holland for this trip.  Went to Rotterdam today to see
about our stateroom for the trip back on the "Statendam".  On the way
back we had a puncture in a rear tire (a nail).  Took us about half
and hour to change tires.<br><br>

<B>Aug 24:</B>  Up at 8:30 a.m.  Made a small sailing ship today by the
people next-door.  It really sails before the wind and nicely too. 
There was a good wind today, so i went and flew my kite on Uncle Leens's
farm.  It pulled quite hard.  Went swimming at the pool right after
that.  The water was cold, but i had a good time diving, etc.  Had a
friendly evening with Tossie.<br><br>
<B>Aug 25:</B>  Went to church this morning.  After church a lot of the
relation had dinner at Aunt Neeltje's where I board.  This afternoon
we went to Boskoop to get Uncle Bert who rode his bike all the way from
Breda (60 miles) during the night.  it rained on the last 15 miles of
his trip to boot.  He had received news that he could come to America,
so he wanted to talk about it.  All of the visitors stayed for supper,
too.<br><br>
<B>Aug 26:</B>  Up at 9:00 a.m.  Put a rudder on my little sail-boat. 
Went for a ride in the row-boat of the skipper, whose ship is anchored
near Uncle Dries store.  Bought the skipper and his two helpers, who
are loading flax, some beer.  That's how I got the rides in the
row-boat.  Went rowing some more this afternoon and this evening. 
The skipper had his boat all loaded and was ready to sail this evening
when one side of the load on the boat fell off.  (The water level in
the river went down and the boat hit bottom and tipped).  He will have
to remove and reload all those bundles of flax.  Learned how to do my
cross-puzzle and another one from the man who gave them to me.<br><br>
<B>Aug 27:</B>  Up at 9:00 a.m.  Went to Boskoop on the bike, about a 15 minute
ride.  Played my aunt Jo's phonograph.  At noon, went to get my
Uncle Cor from the nursery and to get some flowers.  Ate dinner there
and then came back to Waddingsveen.  Uncle Adrian came to visit my
Aunt tonight.  He asked me to come to Boskoop tomorrow.  Turned in
at 10:30 p.m.<br><br>
<B>Aug 28:</B>  Up at 8:00 a.m.  Went and rented a bike after breakfast. 
Rode to Boskoop and Uncle Adrian's house.  Went fishing in a canal
back of the house.  Caught one about 2 inches long (and lost it
again).  After dinner went sailing in a small boat in the canals and
went fishing some more.  Caught another.  I was pushing the boat
back and stepped in a hole along side the canal and got a wet foot. 
They say I'm now baptized a real Boskooper.  Returned to Waddingsveen
at 8:15 p.m.  Paid only 50 cents to rent the bike for the whole day.<br><br>
<B>Aug 29:</B>  Up at 8:30 a.m.  Dad and Mother came at 9:30 a.m.  Went
and got Mr. & Mrs. Van Spronsen near Rotterdam. We all went to Gouda. 
Walked thru the market in front of the City Hall.  Bought a few things
from the merchants (Jews).  Went to the big church in which the world 
- reknowned Gouda window paintings are located.  They are very
beautiful in color.  The painter is said to have been killed because
he would not tell the mixture of the wonderful paint he used.  it is
not known to this day.  The paintings in themselves are beautiful and
wonderful.  The depict stories and scenes from the Bible.  They are
all very realistic and the perspective is very good.  The church was
built in th 13th century and the paintings (glass windows) in the 15th
century.  The pictures were all explained to us by a man from the
church.  Because the church is so old, it is being restored.  This
has gone on for 40 years, but they are now nearly finished.  Church is
still held in the building and there is a beautiful organ in
it.  Stroop Puffertjes.  Great!  Turned in at 10:30.<br><br>
<B>Aug 30:</B>  Up at 9:00 a.m.  Wrote a letter to Evie Van Bree.  It was
very warm today,<br><br>

<!--Page 7-->
<HR size=1><br>

today.  Have been having nice weather nearly every day.  This
evening I rented a row-boat from a ship-maker at 10 cents per hour.  I
had it for and hour and a half.  Had a lot of fun.  Took most of the
children of the neighborhood for rides up and down the river.<br><br>
<B>Aug. 31:</B>  Today was the Queen of Holland's birthday.  Every city and
town has a celebration.  Waddingsveen has theirs next week
Wednesday.  Parade, fireworks and everything.  This afternoon I took
a ride in a Dutch (canoe) kayak.  It is a long, narrow thing.  One
person can just squeeze in it.  I put my bathing suit on for
safety.  It was very hard to balance and I went under three times,
but I got the hang of it now.  Went swimming this evening.  Fine,
because it was warm today.  Took pictures of Mr. Lous today.<br><br>
<B>Sept. 1:</B>  Got up at 10:30 a.m. because Mother and Father came last night and
I didn't go to bed until 12:00 a.m.  Today was Sunday but I couldn't
go to church this morning.  Had dinner at Aunt Belia's.  Mother and
Father, too.  Had a lot of fun with the children this noon.  Had
supper there too.  Met Mr. Lous this noon and he said that I could go
along on a trip with his motor-scow (freight boat) tomorrow, for a three
day and two night trip.<br><br>
<B>Sept. 2:</B>  Up at 9:00 a.m.  Got my stuff
ready to take on the trip.  We were scheduled to sail at 2:00 p.m. 
Helped load some furniture on board.  Passed thru Boskoop and a few
other small towns on the way.  Went thru some locks and a new
canal.  About 8:00 p.m. we entered Amsterdam.  Sailed thru the
canals and saw many sights.  I had brought only my supper along so I
bought some eggs (10 cents each).  At 9:00 p.m. we tied up at a
wharf.  Went for a stroll thru the main street and the slum district
of Amsterdam with the skipper and the helper.  Turned in at 11:00
p.m.<br><br>
<B>Sept. 3:</B>  Got up at 7:30 a.m. to see the sights again. 
slept pretty good in one of the bunks in the cabin.  Passed thru the
shipping harbor of Amsterdam and saw many big ships.  Unloaded some
goods at Zaandam.  Got off the boat at Zaandjke to go to a windmill
musem, but it wasn't open yet.  Took the train to the place where I
was to meet the boat again.  Zaandike is pretty because of all the big
windmills that still stand there.  Most all are still used.  Bought
my breakfast, and dinner and supper at Wormeveer. (Loaf of bread, 1/2 lb
of butter, and a bottle of milk).  There are many big factories in
Wormeveer.  We unloaded grain at a big grain mill.  After dinner I
took a bus back to the museum all about windmills.  Very
interesting.  Met the boat at Zaandam at 6:00 p.m.  From there we
went to one of the biggest lumber yards in the Netherlands.  There was
a strike on, so on every tug boat there was a policeman.  Tugboats
were used instead of trucks to haul the lumber.  slept there that
night.  Slept good too!<br><br>
<B>Sept. 4:</B>  Up at 8:00 a.m.  Went to a
museum in the house where Czar Peter of Russia lived when he learned to
be a ship maker in the Netherlands.  It is very old and out of
shape.  At 10:00 a.m. we started for home.  Passed thru Amsterdam
again, but took a different route back.  Passed over a big lake.  It
was very hot on deck that afternoon because there is no covering.  At
6:30 p.m. we were back in Waddingsveen.  There had been a celebration
for the Queen's birthday.  After cleaning myself up, went to the
moving-picture and fireworks.  Had a lot of fun with some of my
friends.  Saw a couple of drunken men, but they weren't arrested
because beer is sold everywhere after the fireworks.  We (Aunt
and Uncle) sat up with the neighbors until 2:00 a.m.  Then to
bed.<br><br>
<B>Sept. 5:</B>  Up at 11:00 a.m.  Didn't do very much today.  Talked
with Toosie.<br><br>
<B>Sept. 6:</B>  Up at 9:00 a.m.  Took the boat to Boskoop at
11:00 a.m.  Ate dinner at Aunt Jo's.  After dinner went to the
celebration of the Queen's birthday in Boskoop.  Bought some
fireworks.  Had fun watching kids get soaked in the tub-poking
contest.  (Riding a cart down a short incline under a tub of water
which tipped if rider missed the hole in the target).  At night went
to the fireworks with Mother, Father, Uncles Dries and Cor, and Aunts
Neeltje and Jo.  Had a lot of fun, but didn't see much of the
fireworks.  Went to a cafe with dancing where Mother went when she was
young.  Had a dandy time.  to bed at 2:00 a.m.<br><br>
<B>Sept. 7:</B>  Up at
10:00 a.m.  At 1:30 p.m. started for Breda.  Went thru Rotterdam and
Dordretch and over the Dutch deep with the ferry.  Saw the biggest
bridge in the Netherlands.   A long one too.  Saw many sights
along the road.  Got into Breda at 5:00 p.m.  My Uncle Bert lives
in a small portplace.  It is all very old.  Breda is a beautiful old
city with many old fort and churches.  We took a walk thru the
business district and it was very busy because it was Saturday
evening.<br><br>
<B>Sept 8:</B>  Up at 9:30 a.m.  Mother went to the Salvation Army meeting
with my Aunt.  In the afternoon we went to the Catholic Park in
Belgium with our auto.  The park was just over the border, but
Hollanders are allowed to go there without passports.  The park was
very beautiful and there were many life-size statutes of Christ's walk
to the Cross and the Crucifixion.  We were in Belguim, so we could use
Belguim money.  For 35 cents Dutch money I got 12 peices of Belfium
money which amounted to 5 Francs.  Later, I watched my Uncle develope
some of my pictures.<br><br>
<B>Sept 9:</B>  Up at 9:00 a.m.  Went and took a couple of pictures in
the town.  At 11:00 a.m. we started for home again.  Ate dinner in a
swell dafe in Rotterdam at 3:00 p.m.  I was supposed to go to Den
Hague, but I said I would rather go home (Waddingsveen).  When we got
there, I found out it was planned for next week, so everything was all
right again.  I was to go because the Queen was going to ride in her
gold coach.<br><br>
<B>Sept 10:</B>  Tomorrow is my birthday, so I stayed around the bridge at
Waddingsveen today.  Didn't have much to do.  Made an airplane for
Arie VandeWater.<br><br>

<B>Sept. 11:</B> (Birthday): Up at 9:00 a.m. My Grandfather Kersbergen had come
all the way from Boskoop on his bike and he was here before I got up. He
came upstairs and he gave me a note for 25 Guilders and said it was my
birthday present. It amounted to $10 in American money, but it is a
fortune over here, and to me too. He said I could buy anything I wanted
to for it, to take along to America. When I came down stairs, my Aunt
gave me a little box with a beautiful gold ring with a sparkling stone
in it. It was from the whole Heyns family together and it was very
beautiful. At 11:00 a.m. I took the boat to Boskoop with Mother and
Father. Went to my Uncle's house for coffee time. Stayed there until
after dinner. My Uncle gave me a dandy magnifying glass because I liked
one so. From there we started back to Waddingsveen. Stopped at my Aunt
Trj's housse and aasked her to come to the party. About 7:00 p.m. I
began to bring the people to the bridge with the auto. (The bridge is
the place where my Aunt Neeltje lives). I got a pencil outfit for the
desk from Mother. It made so that the pencil is always handy and can
never get lost. Got a birthday book from Aunt Coba; the book Ben Hur
from cousin Dit Verwy. It was written in Dutch, but she was going to try
and get an English publication. Got a souvineer drinking glass from the
neighbor lady of my Grandmother Heyns. There were 26 guests in all and
we had a dandy time with drinks on the table and tarts to eat. I took
two flash pictures of the whole group. I hope they turn out good.
Everybody had such a good time that they didn't start home until 12:00
a.m. and that's very late for the farmers around here. Some of them were
a little tipsy when they went home, but everything went fine. My great
grandmother was at the party too. She is 94, but had as much fun as
anyone. I'll say I had a dandy birthday here in Holland. Turned in at
1:00 a.m.<br><br>
<B>Sept 12:</B> Up at 10:00 a.m. Mother and Father came after me and
I drove to Amsterdam to my Aunt's house. That evening we took a walk
thru the city and saw the sights.<br><br>
<B>Sept. 13:</B> This afternoon my Father, Grandfather and I took a trip to
Marken and Volendam. We had to go by steam-tram and then by boat. I left
my Kodak on the steam-tram and had to call the next station to have them
hold it there; but the worst of it was, that I couldn't take any
pictures of the people in Marken. The people of Marken are just like you
see them on pictures. The children wear the same kind of clothes as the
old people, but the small boys have long hair, the same as the girls. It
was all very interesting. Marken is an island and sometimes it gets
flooded, so all the houses and building are built on poles. The people
all have wooden shoes on. The women wear long dresses and the men, pants
with very wide pant legs. The clothes are all highly colored. In
Volendam the dress is nearly the same, but not so colorful. When we were
there the men, mostly all fishermen, were thru with work. They all sat
on the street in groups and talked together. The street was nearly
flooded with tobacco juice in front of them. We got home at 7:30 p.m.<br><br>
<B>Sept. 14:</B> (Amsterdam) Didn't do much in the morning. In the afternon, I
took cousin Trien's bicycle and went for a ride thru a big park nearby
and on some of the main streets. It sure was busy. While I was in
Amsterdam, I saw what is left of Old Amsterdam. This is in the very
heart of the city, but it is all surrounded by buildings. You enter it
thru a small archway. When you are inside, it is like a dream because it
is so quiet in there. Very impressing. After supper we went to the movie<br><br>

<!--Page 9-->
<HR size=1><br>

"Show Boat" which was playing for the first time in Amsterdam. It was a
talking film made in America, so all the talking was in English. It
seemed good to hear real English again.  made in America, all the
talking was in English. It seemed goood to hear real English again.<br><br>
<B>Sept. 15:</B> This afternoon we went for a ride.  We planned to go to
Volendam so that I could take pictures.  First we went to see what
will be the biggest locks for ships, in the world.  It is 100 meters
long, about 50 meters longer than the Panama locks.  It is 27 meters
deep - nearly 90 feet.  Its a very big job and will take 10 years to
finish it.  We then started for Volendam, but on the way the car
stopped because a gas line got plugged.  After waiting about two
hours, in which time we found out we had a flat tire and changed it, a
garage man came.  After he said he had it fixed, we drove on for 15
minutes when she stopped again.  We got the same man to fix it again,
but it was getting dark so he took the car to his garage and we went
to Amsterdam by bus.  He said he would bring the car the next
day.  The worst of it was that I couldn't take pictures again.  We
got home at 9:30 p.m.<br><br>
<B>Sept. 16:</B>  Went and got the children from the private school with my
Aunt Woutrien.  After dinner, I told them all Goodbye, because I would
not see them again before I went back to America.  Walked down to one
of the main squares of Amsterdam where the office of the Royal Dutch
Airlines is located.  Bought my ticket for Rotterdam for 7.50 Guilders
or about $3.00.  Had to wait about 15 minutes for the bus, which was
to take the other passengers and I to the flying field.  This was a
regular service, not a pleasure service.  It is about a 20 minute
ride.  In the bus I was a little nervous, thinking about the trip, but
as soon as I got to the flying field, I felt all right again.  We all
stepped into the passenger compartment.  There were seats for 12 and
there were eleven passengers.  Before we got in, everyone was given a
piece of cotton-batting to put in their ears.  After the motors (2)
were warmed up, we started off.  It sounded just like two big trucks
pulling up hill, but it didn't feel much worse than going up in a fast
elevator.  When we got up we seemed to be going about 10 miles an
hour.  The cows grazing on the land below looked like flies on pieces
of green paper.  We went over a couple of lakes and the sailboats
looked like toys.  The windmills were very small, too.  Rotterdam
was a toy city with specks for people.  The "Statendam" was a big toy
boat, that lay in a tiny creek.  It was all wonderful, but there was
nothing exciting about the flying itself.  When we came down for the
landing you could see for the first time that we were going fast. 
Took a few pictures after I got out, then started for Waddingsveen.  I
had to go all the way thru Rotterdam to get to the bus.  It was a nice
ride on the street cars and I got there allright by using my tongue,
because I was all alone.  The flying time from Amsterdam to Rotterdam
was 25 minutes.  An auto takes two hours to do it.  Got in
Waddingsveen about 7:30 p.m., before Mother and Father.  Sept. 16
Had to tell Toosie all about it.<br><br>
<B>Sept. 17:</B>  Didn't do anything
unusual today.<br><br>
<B>Sept. 18:</B>  Slowly on we are beginning to say Goodbye to
our relatives, because we leave next week Thursday.<br><br>
<B>Sept. 19:</B>  Went to Den Hague today.  We were going to visit
relatives of the Van Soets, but Mother forgot her address book and she
didn't know the address. We went to the beach at Schevenigen today. Saw
a couple of fishing boats leave the harbor., with all the wives, mothers
and sweethearts telling "Goodbye" until they couldn't be seen
anymore.<br><br>
<B>Sept. 20 & 21:</B>  More Goodbyes.<br><br> 
<B>Sept. 22:</B>  Went to church for the last time in Holland, this
morning.<br><br>
<B>Sept. 23:</B>  Went to Den Hague again today.  Visited the museum
"Mesdag".  In it is the most wonderful panorama I ever saw. 
Everything is life-like on the painting because of the way the light
falls on it.  Went to a big department store and bought a shaving
outfit for half the money my Grandfather gave me for my birthday.<br><br>
<B>Sept. 24:</B>  My Aunt Neeltje's birthday.  Said more "Goodbyes".<br><br>
<B>Sept. 25:</B>  Took pictures and exchanged addresses with my Dutch friends. 
We are going to write each other.  There was a wreck on the Gouwa
River tonight.  A drunken skipper ran into another boat.  The police
came and put them in jail for the night.  You are allowed to drink
over here, but you may not be drunken.  Went to bed at 11:30 p.m. for
the last time in Netherlands.<br><br>
<B>Sept. 26:</B>  Up at 9:00 a.m.  Rented a bike and rode to Boskoop to
say "Goodby" some more.  Told the VandeWaters "Goodbye" this noon. 
Little Kaasie wanted to go along with me.  Took the bus with my mother
and 8 relatives to Rotterdam.  My dad had gone this morning to get the
car on board the ship.  We all went on board and took a look around
the big, new ship.  They all liked it.  At 7:20 p.m. we started to
sail for America after saying "Goodbye" many times to all my good
friends in Holland.  Stayed up until we passe the "Hook of
Holland".<br><br>

<B>Sept. 27:</B> We were in Boulonge, France this morning when I got up. 
Stayed ther until after noon loading autos and passengers.  Sailed
past the beautiful dliffs of Dover and anchored at Southhampton; waited
about two hours for passengers.<br><br>
<B>Sept. 28:</B>  Had our last sight of land for a few days, this morning. 
The sea is quite rough and the ship rocks some too.  There is a strong
wind and it is cold and cloudy.  Went up to the bow this evening. 
It is quite a ways walking because the ship is so big.  Took a
salt-water bath tonight, the first real bath since I have been in
Holland.<br><br>
<B>Sept. 29:</B>  The weather and sea is a little worse today.  There are
quite a few seasick and I don't feel like a million dollars either. 
The "Leviathan" passed us going East.  Went up to the bow again today
and took a few pictures.  Climbed up to the Crow's Nest by a little
ladder which is inside the forward mast.  It was a long climb because
the crow's nest is high on the mast.  A seaman lookout was there. 
He let me look around, but warned me to stay in front of the mast so I
would not be seen by the officers on the bridge.  As the ship rolled,
the mast and Crow's Nest would swing back and forth - quite a thrill!<br><br>
<B>Sept. 30:</B>  Up at 8:00 a.m.  We have luncheon at 1:15 p.m. and dinner
at 7:00 p.m. everyday because they have to serve two "tables" and we
are on the second.  A Cunnard liner passed us this noon, going
west.  I think it was the "Berengaria".  It passed real close and we
could see everything on the ship very plain.  It was a wonderful sight
to see the big ship roll in the ocean the same as we were doing.  Went
to the movie tonight - "Women They Talk About".  It was pretty
good.  We gain about 45 minutes every night so we get enough sleep and
must reset our watches.<br><br>
<B>Oct. 1:</B>  Played shuffle board and deck tennis.  The weather was
pretty good today and the ocean swells were less.  Watched the horse
races (make-believe) on 2nd Class this noon.  We are Tourist Class.<br><br>
<B>Oct. 2:</B>  Up at 7:30 a.m.  It was misty most all day, but the wind
and sea were calm.  Had the Horse races on Tourist Class deck
today.  I won a few stakes of 75 cents each.  Saw a lot of
three-masted fishing schooners, so we must be just off the banks of New
Foundland.  It won't be long now before we make port.  It is cold
this evening because we are a long ways north.  Saw a big school of
porpoises close by the ship and saw a liner headed east also.<br><br>
<B>Oct. 3:</B>  Again played shuffle board, and took pictures.  Had another
Horse race this noon on Second Class, but didn't win anything.  About
2:30 p.m. we ran into a storm.  The wind was so strong that if I
opened my coat, I could slide on the wet deck at a good speed.  The
waves got so high that a few sprayed over the lower deck and water ran
towards the stern.  So we had a little taste of a storm after all. 
Went to a movie - "Stolen Kisses" at 9:00 p.m.<br><br>
<B>Oct. 4:</B>  Up at 7:30
a.m.  Went to the bow this morning to see the waves spray over the
front deck.  Got pretty wet while I watched because the waves sprayed
me too.  The wind was so strong that we could hardly stand up.  Went
and took a look at the First Class swimming pool and gym this noon. 
The pool is beautifully finished in green tile, although it is quite
small.  The gym is very well equipped.  It has two electric
horses.  I rode, and I could hear my bones rattle at full speed. 
Passed Nantucket Light Ship at 8:45 p.m., so we'll get into New York
tomorrow.  Didn't get to bed until 12:00 a.m. because we all had a
wort of "Farewell" party in the Bar Room.  Had a lot of fun with
singing and drinking (non-alcholic for me) because it was the last night
aboard ship.<br><br>
<B>Oct. 5:</B>  Up at 6:00 a.m. because breakfast was to be
served at 6:30 a.m.  At 7:00 a.m. we had our first sight of land. 
At 8:30 we stopped at Quarentine to take the inspectors and doctors on
board.  Then we proceeded to New York harbor.  It was a wonderful
sight when we entered the harbor with the Statue of Liberty on the
left and the tall buildings of New York City on the right, the Woolworth
Building standing above the rest.  Then further on all the big docks
with some of the world's largest ocean liners berthed there.  We
docked at 11:00 a.m.  At 11:30 a.m. the "New Amsterdam" liner started
its trip to Holland again.  We saw it back out of the pier, with
tugs.  Just at that time 5 other ocean liners started for Europe so
you can see it was a  most beautiful and wonderful sight - to see all
the large liners sail majestically down the Hudson River with numerous
small boats and tugs surrounding them and with New York City in the
background.  At 11:45 a.m. we got off the ship, but we had to wait
until about 3:00 to have our baggage checked over by customs officials
and to have our car unloaded.  The dock was swarming with all kinds of
people, so we couldn't hurry if we wanted to.  After that we ate
dinner in a restaurant where they served beer by the meals just as if it
was a common affair and that was in the middle of Hoboken too.  (1929 
- Prohibition was in effect.)  We said Goodbye to Cor Ouddyk who had
met us at the dock and then started driving towards home.  We were
soon in the mountains again.  We passed over one mountain that was
1,003 feet above sea level and we had just come from sea level in
Hoboken, so we did some climbing.  The sun was just going down over
the mountains and it was a most wonderful sight.  We stayed in the
Washington House, Stroudsburg, Pa.  Took a walk thru town before going
to bed.<br><br>
<B>Oct 6:</B>  Up at 7:00 a.m.  Drove 'til 9:00 a.m. and had a fan belt
fixed on the car because they had not put it on straight in Holland. 
After breadfast, drove thru the mountains all day.  Saw some wonderful
scenery.  Once we saw a train go along the face of a mountain, while
we were on top.  It looked small but it was very long.  Drove all
day until 9:30 p.m. - then stopped at the Eagle Hotel in a little town
outside of Erie, Pa.<br><br>
<B>Oct 7:</B>  Had breakfast at 7:00 a.m.  Drove thru Erie and
Cleveland.  Nothing interesting was to be seen on this part of the
trip.  At 8:30 p.m. we arrived in Grand Rapids and at 9:00 p.m. I
stepped into my own home again and it seemed good, too!  So this is
the end of my trip to Europe and the most wonderful fime of my life. 
Saw 4 foreign countries, 5 states of America and traveled 10,000 miles
in 2 1/2 months of travel, 2,000 by auto and 8,000 by boat.<br><br>
