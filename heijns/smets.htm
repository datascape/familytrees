In early 1999 we received a copy of a copy of 
a “Heyns alias Smets” family genealogy from Jacky Rudeen, 
the sister of former UC Berkley Chancellor Roger Heyns.  
This may be the genealogy sent to Roger by the Hungarian 
book seller.  We have yet to find a relation to any living 
Heyns descendants.<br><br>

The genealogy, printed in old French, dates from 1543 to 1762 
and has many births, marriages and deaths in Malines, Belgium 
(The French spelling for the Flemish town of Mechelen, Belgium.)   
It contains several hundred Heyns relatives, many with French first names.  
Flor Heyns (florent.heyns@alcatel.be) reports that in Belgium there 
are currently more then 60 families named “Heyns”.<br><br>

It’s interesting to note that throughout the genealogy, 
individuals are referred to as “Heyns alias Smets”  
(Heyns going by Smets).  One possible reason for the 
use of a different surname may have been that the family 
did not want to be identified as Heyns Huguenots.  
During the French Huguenot Wars, French Protestants 
were driven out of France to the east, some settling 
in Belgium and some in The Netherlands.  Others moved 
to areas such as England, Germany, Switzerland and the 
North American colonies.<br><br>

We’ll be looking forward to any additional information related 
to the Smet branch you might find.    
Anyone interested in helping to transcribe (with appropriate accent marks) 
and translate from old French, please let us know. 
One of the two married daughters of Ann Heyns DeBeer in 
Grand Rapids, Michigan may have an original copy of the 24 page chart.  
Since it was type-set (probably in the late 1700s), rather than 
handwritten, there may be other original prints.<br><br>
