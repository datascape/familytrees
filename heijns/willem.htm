I visited the homepage you're involved in on the Heyns family tree. Very
interesting!!!! I am a Heijns myself and my family lives in the Ter Aar
region, Netherlands.<br><br>

My name is Anne Claire Heijns (born Alphen aan den Rijn, 1975), daughter
of Dirk Heijns (born Ter Aar, 1947), granddaughter of Pieter Willem
Heijns (born Ter Aar, 1911) descending from Willem Wijnandt Heijns who,
as I was told, came to Holland from Hannover, Germany. I once saw a
family tree that went back to the time Wijnandt Heijns came from
Germany, but didn't know anything more. Until I saw your website! I see
there is not so many Dutch people on your mailing list, but both me and
my father would be very interested. Can we become part of the list, or
contribute in some way? <br><br>

Greetings from a far-away cousin,<br><br>

Anne
