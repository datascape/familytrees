<B>Gerson Levi Heins (1784-184?)</B><br><br>

Greetings from Melbourne, Australia...
The family name HEINS appears on our family tree (a data base of almost 4500
connected persons) in the family of one of my great grandmothers, Brendel
Bertha HEINS, born 25 Apr 1833 in Gandersheim and died 24 Mar 1864 in
Vlotho.<br><br>

Bertha is a daughter of Gerson Levi HEINS (1784-184?) and Blümchen WEISE (b.
1799). Bertha's known siblings are:<br><br>

Carl Gerson b.1821<br>
Philipp b. 1823<br>
Emilie b. 1825<br>
Meier b. (1827-46)<br>
Rosalie (1835-45)<br>
Moritz b. 1835<br><br>

On 5 Jul 1854 in Vlotho Bertha Heins married Harry Herz Salomon HEINEMANN
(spelling later changed by him to HEYNEMANN) who was a tanner and leather
merchant in Bad Oeynhausen.<br><br>

These families were German Jewish; my deceased father, born of a Jewish
mother who married a German Lutheran, would be regarded as having been born
a Jew but he was non-practising (any formal religion in fact) all his life,
both before and after he married my Catholic mother whose faith now extends
to my wife, children and granddaughter!<br><br>

Thanks again, Lauren, and all the best from down under.<br><br>
