<B>Garrett Heyns (1891-1969)</B><br><br>

Superintendent of Holland, Michigan 
Christian Schools and Director of Prisons in Michigan and Washington,  
Garrett Heyns ended a prison riot in Seattle.<br><br>

An article of the life of Garrett Heyns Reports:<br>
Garrett Heyns gained national recognition for his dedication
to improving, and reforming the penal institutions of Michigan and Washington. His drive to transform prisons sprang from a sense of fairness
and justice rooted in his Christian faith.<br><br>

Heyns was convinced that many young People wound up in prison
because they lacked practical skills and a sense of direction in life.
Heyns tried to provide both, through a variety of vocational
training and educational programs.<br><br>

Because of his strong belief in the value of education for a healthy society, Heyns originally set 
his sights on a career as a teacher. He took his A.B., M.A., and Ph.D. in medieval history at the University of Michigan, and subsequently taught and held administrative
positions at several elementary and secondary schools. Heyns held these jobs during the Depression, and many of the Christian schools for which he worked often failed to meet their budgets.
It was during these years of working within organizations under stress that Heyns realized the importance of mutual respect among the members of these organizations.
This period of his life also reaffirmed for Heyns the belief that education was the key to the well-being of the individual and of society.<br><br>

It was also during this time that Heyns and a group of fellow Christian educators began working together to discover how their Christian beliefs should work practically in their professional lives. For the members of this group, Christian living required a practical involvement with the problems of society and a deep concern for the advancement of its individual members.<br><br>
In 1937 the governor of Michigan decided to reorganize the state's prison system, putting what formerly had been part of the political spoils system under the civil service. Educators were chosen to replace law enforcement officials as heads of prisons, and the philosophical emphasis on punishment and segregation shifted to education and rehabilitation. Garrett Heyns was among the first educators chosen to implement the new approach; he was appointed warden of the Ionia Reformatory.<br><br>
Heyns later served Michigan as director of corrections, and in 1948 he was chairman of the Parole Board. But it was his eventual return, at his request, to his position as warden at Ionia that gave him the most satisfaction. Direct contact with inmate rehabilitation was the work that motivated Heyns, and his humane concern for prisoners as persons helped many of them return to society with the practical skills they needed to build new lives.<br><br>
During his years in Michigan, Garrett Heyns was active in corrections work on a national level. He served as president of the American Prison Association, the American Correctional Association, and the American Parole Association. He wrote articles for professional journals and spoke at regional, national, and international meetings on corrections-related subjects. During World War 11, Heyns served as an adviser to the secretary of war on military prisoners. He was also a member of the corrections task force of the President's commission on law enforcement and administration of justice.<br><br>
In 1957, the year Heyns retired at age 66 as warden of Ionia, he received an urgent invitation from the governor of Washington. The state's department of institutions was in shambles and in dire need of Garrett Heyns's expertise.<br><br>
Heyns devoted the next nine years of his life to getting Washington's Department of Corrections back on track. He reorganized and modernized the correctional system; he initiated modern programs for treatment of the mentally ill and the physically challenged; and he raised the standards of the state juvenile rehabilitation program to a model of excellence for the entire nation. In nine years Heyns built the Washington Corrections Department into one of the most respected in the country. It was another testimony to his rich life of Christian dedication and service transforming
social institutions and touching the lives of countless men and women.<br><br>
Garrett Heyns received the first Calvin Distinguished Alumni Award in 1966. His son, Roger, received the same award in 1969, the only father-and-son combination to be so honored by Calvin College.<br><br>
