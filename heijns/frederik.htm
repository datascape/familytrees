Arie immigrated to Canada from Holland in the
late 1940s (approx).  Jennifer writes, "My mother also immigrated to 
Canada from Holland and
they met at a Dutch church in Owen Sound, Ontario.  
My father's family
came over to Canada after he and his brother, William, had been in
Brandon, Manitoba for some time, 
but they decided to settle in Owen Sound."
