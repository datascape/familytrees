Farm house built at the Hain Farm in the early 1700's. In 1863 Sophie Marie Dorothee Heine (* 2. Febr. 1820 in Wohlenhausen, + 18. Febr. 1879 in Lemke) and her husband Christian Kanning purchased the family farmhouse. As of 2005, the great-great-granddaughter of Sophie lives in the house.  



# The Old Farmhouse of Heine (Heynen, Hain, Hajne, Heins)

### In Lemke very near Wohlenhausen, Germany

According to descendants of the Heins family living in Lemke, the name Hein means thorn-hedge.  

Anne Hains and her father Johan Hain were the original land owners. The -s ending indicates a maternal origin of the name in ones children.  They provide the origin of the Heins name that later transitioned to Heijns (in the Netherlands) and then Heyns (in the US and South Africa).  


The following research extends a photocopy of the hand-drawn genealogy chart sent from Leen Ramp, of Boskoop, Netherlands to his cousin William Heyns in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The chart spans from 1701 to 1968 and contains about 200 relatives with drawings (tracings) of about 35 male family members. There is one female member - Johanna (Heijns) Vander Wilk (d. Aug 21, 1971) - who either created or added on to the chart. (The hand-drawn chart may incorrectly state that Anna Buelter was Peter's brother Johan's widow.)  

William Heyns writes: "Leen Ramp, son of Adrian Ramp: Adrian's first wife Elisabeth (Heijns) Ramp (b. Moerkapelle Dec 12, 1889, d. Jan 27, 1921) passed away before Leen was born to Adrian's second wife Coba, Leen's mother. Coba was a fine mother to all the Ramp children and I used to correspond with her about the whole family while she was living. Leen was also close to his half-brothers and sisters. Half-brother Wim Ramp and wife Jans (Goedhart-Ramp) inherited the Family chart from Aunt Johanna (Heijns) Vander Wilk (d. Aug 21, 1971), and on one occasion mentioned it to Leen after I had written to him about family record search. That's when Leen sent us the photocopy of the chart. All very providential and we could not have developed the website without it. Leen is now quite ill and my latest contacts have been with Wim Koster who can not write English and we must depend on his daughter to communicate." (Leen Ramp died April 23, 2001. We have stayed in contact with Jos Ramp and Ellen Verhoeven.)  


## Peter Freiershaus (Freuershaus, zum Freyershaus)

Supporting Document prepared by geneologist in Germany: [Parenteel Van Peter Freiershaus ](20070204_ParenteelVanPeterFreiershaus.doc)  

Peter's original surname may have been Stueve and his wife’s maiden name may have been Freuershaus (since they had a son Gerd Stuve/Stueve called Freuershaus). North German (Stüve): from Middle German stuve ‘stump’, hence a topographic name for someone who lived on newly cleared land.  
  
Peter's wife's first name is unknown.

## Peter Freuershaus (or Stuve called Freuershaus)

<img style="float:right; margin-left:40px" src="img/farm/Kartenausschnitt-Wohlenhausen.jpg">

<b>First wife:</b> Anna Elisabeth Hain (Hajn, Heins) - our namesake - married Peter in Marklohe on 29 Jun 1682, Evangelical Lutheran Church. Anna was the daughter of the deceased Hajn Johan from Wohlenhausen.  

Peter Freuershaus changed his name to Peter Heyn in 1682 when marrying Anna Elisabeth Hain (Hajn, Heins) of the Hain Farm. The farm house above was built at the Hain Farm in the early 1700's and is most likely where Peter and his family lived.  

In the Hoya/Diepholz area of Germany (including Marklohe) a man usually changed his name when he took over a farm that had another name (so the name of the farm was more important than the man's original surname).
