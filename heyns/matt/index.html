<h1>The Story of Matt's Self Serve, Cash and Carry</h1>

Matthijs started and owned some of the first grocery stores with aisles where shoppers could select their own items. Matthijs&#39;s son William says, "My Dad&#39;s grocery business was known as &#39;Matt&#39;s Self Serve, Cash and Carry.&#39;" Grandson Larry Heyns adds that Matthijs was also president of the Michigan Retail Grocers and Meat Dealers Association and director of Grocers Co-operative Dairy Company.<br><br>

Cheryl Dalton wrote 5/16/2003: Dear Bill, today I chatted with Fred Meijer at the store and he remembers you and asked if I saw you. I told him you were 90 and he said he was 84. He remembers your dad using you (and your legal skills) as a threat for shoplifters and also visiting upstairs on S. Division your dad and Irene. He is quite a talker and his wife kept trying to say 'we have to go'. He certainly has done <a href="https://www.meijergardens.org/">neat things</a> for our community and I do like shopping at Meijers. What a terrific store at Knapp's Corners.<br><br>

Hi, Cheryl: It was neat that you could chat with Fred Meijer (a millionaire) and I feel honored that he remembers me after all these years. He must have a great memory as well as business ability. Enjoy the weather and have a great week. - Bill -<br><br>

<h2>Ryna Heyns trip to Grand Rapids</h2>
<!--
Source: Grand Rapids Press Article titled "Ryna Heyns trip to Grand Rapids"<br><br>

Read of Mrs. Ryna Heyns of the Netherlands and Her Charming Impressions of America.<br>
&nbsp;<br>

This Article was in the Grand Rapids Press in 1936 along with the following 3 &frac12; X 5 picture of Rijna.  Rijna visited Grand Rapids in 1933 when her grand son William was attending Hope College. She wondered why Americans used refrigertors during winter when food could be kept fresh by placing it outside.<br><br>

&nbsp;<br>


<img src="img/rijna-lg.jpg"><br>

&quot;The last of life, for which the first was made.&quot;<br><br>


The figure in this picture portraying the mellow contentment of age is MRS RYNA HEYNS, on her first visit from the Netherlands to the United States and marvelous Grand Rapids. She thinks it isn&#39;t fair for her son to do &quot;so much business.&quot;&nbsp; Can&#39;t see the logic in heating an entire house and at the same time spend money to keep things cool.<br>
<br>
Vastness of America, speed of traffic, merchandising methods and the people all combine to make this country truly a new world for Mrs. Ryna Heyns, who has spent all of her 74 years in South Holland, The Netherlands.<br>
<br>
Of course she had read about America, the land to which her son Matt had gone 25 years ago and her son John in 1922. She had read the the state of Michigan was a third larger than all of Holland. She had read of the credit extended in the operation of business enterprise.<br>
<br>
AND IT WAS ALL TRUE!<br>
But not until she arrived here a few days ago did she realize that all of the things she had read about were true. &nbsp;&nbsp; &#39;I&#39;m quite tired, let&#39;s hurry home,&quot; she told her son, Matt Heyns, 101 Cheshire Dr. N.E., who met her at the boat in New York to take her by motorcar to his home here for a visit. &nbsp;&nbsp; And then the ride!&nbsp; At a speed she never expected to experience, the car sped across New York State, through Ontario and then across Michigan.&nbsp; &quot;All in two days!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How does Matt know the way home?&quot; she inquired of Mrs. Matt Heyns after they had traveled some distance.&nbsp; And then it was explained that he watched the highway markers.&nbsp; It was some time, however, before it all was understandable, and then she joined in and watched the numbered signs. She thought it was fun. The speed was all right with her. She liked it.<br>
<br>
Her first meal in America was grand American waffles were fine, but when she found the order served her in the Albany N.Y. restaurant was too much for her, she wrapped the leftover in a napkin and ate it en route.<br>
<br>
She heard about Niagara Falls; the splendor of the scene thrilled her.<br>
<br>
Hotels were new in her life. She had seen them on her visits to Rotterdam, the metropolis and seaport of her native state, but now she had spent two nights in them!<br>
<br>
And when the party crossed the river at Port Huron and landed in Michigan, surely they must be near home.<br>
<br>
DISTANCE - DISTANCE - DISTANCE!<br>
It was 2 o&quot;clock in the afternoon when they arrived at Owosso and Matt went into a drug store to telephone his brother John, in Grand Rapids, advising him to arrange for dinner. &nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I just talked on the phone with John,&quot; Matt told his mother. &nbsp;&nbsp; Then after riding an hour more, she began to realize that John must have been a long way from where Matt had telephoned and she marveled at the ease with which people in America communicate.<br>
<br>
AND THEN THE PALACE!<br>
But her greatest thrills were yet to come. She arrived at Matt?s fine home.&nbsp; Matt, her son, who at the age of 17 had left his father&#39;s dairy farm to go to America. She had seen beautiful homes in The Netherlands, but this one ? her son&#39;s- was it possible?<br>
<br>
There were many things about the house that fascinated Mrs. Heyns.&nbsp; The glistening white box in the kitchen she learned was a device to keep things cold.&nbsp; And the plant in the basement was a steam boiler, fired for the purpose of heating the house!<br>
<br>
And now after several days at the home, she still can&#39;t feel the logic of shoveling fuel into the furnace to heat the entire house, not just a couple of rooms, as is customary in her native land, and then installing a machine that operated 24 hours a day to cool the foodstuffs. It&#39;s a waste to her way of reasoning.&nbsp; The frequently reminds Matt that he ?had better training at home.?<br>
<br>
Just as Matt explained to her American merchandising methods and took her to visit a store - also his!<br>
<br>
THE MARVELS OF BUSINESS.<br>
She found groceries, vegetables, baked goods, meats and other provisions. In the Netherlands business are operated differently, each commodity being sold in a separate store.<br>
<br>
Here she paused to chastise her son. She thought he was &quot;greedy trying to keep his competitors from doing business.&quot;&nbsp; The baker, the butcher and the fruit merchant, she said, each should handle his line and Matt should handle his own specialty.<br>
<br>
And she still can&#39;t understand why merchants light the front of their shops after closing hour.<br>
<br>
In a few days she has been in Grand Rapids she has met friends she had known from the Netherlands. She has visited churches in the city and all-in-all believes Grand Rapids is just about the &quot;grandest&#39; place on earth.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Heyns came here for the twenty-fifth wedding anniversary year of her son Matt.&nbsp; Her mother, only three months short of 100 years old died about a year ago.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Heyns&#39; health is excellent.<br>
