Birthday in Holland... There were 26 guests in all and we had a dandy time with drinks on the table and tarts to eat. I took two flash pictures of the whole group. I hope they turn out good. Everybody had such a good time that they didn't start home until 12:00 a.m. and that's very late for the farmers around here. Some of them were a little tipsy when they went home, but everything went fine. My great grandmother was at the party too. She is 94, but had as much fun as anyone. I'll say I had a dandy birthday here in Holland. Turned in at 1:00 a.m.<br><br>

<b>July 21:</b> Started from Grand Rapids at 1:45 p.m., Sunday. Arrived in Perrysburg, Ohio (near Toledo) at 7:30 p.m. and registered at the Perrysburg Hotel.<br>
<br>
<b>July 22:</b> Started from Perrysburg Hotel at 4:00 a.m. Traveled thru Ohio and Pennsylvania to Grand View Point, PA. and stayed in the Grand View Hotel that night. The roads were very hilly and it was dangerous driving, but the scenery was beautiful. Passed over the highest peaks in the East - Mount Bald Knob, 2,906 ft. In the morning we saw a wonderful sight - a fog, or really a cloud, in the valley below us. We were really above the clouds.<br>
<br>
<b>July 23:</b> Started from Grand View Hotel at 7:30 a.m. Drove thru the mountains and got a view of 50 miles of country. Had to climb and go down grades 5 miles long. Arrived at Uncle Gerrit's place at 3:30 p.m. It is near Pheonixville, PA. Am having a dandy time with the 10 children.<br>
<br>
<b>July 25:</b> Started from Uncle Gerrit's at 4:30 p.m. Arrived at Uncle John's house in Murray Hill, NJ at 9:30 p.m. Watched Cor graft rose buds. Climbed up the water tower and took pictures of the surrounding neighborhood.<br>
<br>
<b>July 26:</b> Started from Uncle John's at 7:30 a.m. Drove thru the Holland Tunnel under the Hudson River. Arrived at the boat dock (pier) at Hoboken, NJ at 10:00 a.m. Had car (1928 Nash 4 Dr., Dual Ignition) washed, and Dad drove to the dock at 1:00 p.m. Took picture of car being lifted aboard by deck crane. Waited in nearby park and boarded ship after supper at 8:15 p.m. Spent time before sailing looking over ship and cabins (<a href="http://www.greatships.net/nieuwamsterdam.html">S.S. New Amsterdam</a>, Captain: J. K. Lieuwen). Departed dock at 12:15 a.m. Sailed past New York loop and Statue of Liberty and turned in at 1:00 a.m.<br>
<br>
<b>July 27:</b> Got up at 6:30 a.m. Saw 7 ships during the day. Ate breakfast at 8:00 a.m. Saw a whale spout in the morning. Ate lunch at 1:00 p.m. Played Shuffle Board in the afternoon. Ate dinner at 7:00 p.m. Went to bed at 9:30 p.m. after taking a salt water bath. Slept fine that night.<br>
<br>
<b>July 28:</b> Got up at 7:00 a.m. Saw a school of Dolphins off starboard (1/2 mile away) before breakfast. Saw another school off port after lunch, only about 50 yds away. One of the fish raced the ship, but gave up. Entered and lost in a shuffle board tournament. Saw only one ship, a freighter during the day. The sea was a little rougher in the evening than before. Turned in at 10:20 p.m.<br>
<br>
<b>July 29:</b> Got up at 7:15 a.m. Played deck tennis for the first time; shuffle board in the afternoon. After supper (at 8:30 p.m.) watched a movie which was pretty good. Didn't see either ships or fish during the whole day. At 8:30 p.m. saw a light, probably a ship, but that was all. Turned in at 10:35 p.m.<br>
<br>
<b>July 30:</b> Got up at 8:00 a.m. Played deck tennis and shuffle board. Saw about 50 flying fish during the day. They were silver colored and about 6 inches long. they glided about 20 yards and sometimes went 5 feet high. It was fun to see them. Didn't see any ships at all today. We were going east, but we turned northeast today. Had fun in the dining room before going to bed. Was introduced to &quot;Doggie&quot; today.<br>
<!--Page 2-->
<hr size="1" /><br>
<b>July 31:</b> Got up at 7:45 a.m. Saw a square-rigger in full flight. Slept a while after lunch. Passed thru a fog before dinner. The ship's horn blew a few seconds every minute for about an hour. Went thru the First Class and up to the bow of the ship before dinner. saw some interesting things. Had a dance on the second deck at 9:00 p.m. heard that this ship uses about 400 carloads of coal every trip. There are 18 stokers at work all the time. They earn only $40 a month. Stewards receive only $24 and some only $19 a month. I know of a few men who are working their way across and they don't get anything. The stewards say that their meals and sleeping quarters are poor, but the passengers are handled better on this line than on any other. We get dandy meals and service. Turned in at 12:00 a.m.<br>
<br>
<b>Aug 1:</b> Got up at 8:30 a.m. Went thru the whole ship today. First, I went to the engine room and saw all the hugh machinery. The propeller shaft is about 100 feet long and 1 1/2 ft. in diameter, made of solid steel. Saw the water pumps and the big cylinders which drive the propellers. Each shaft (2) is driven by four connecting rods. it is very hot in the engine room and by the stokers in the boiler room, it is about 120 degrees. There are four rows of boiler furnaces and there are forty-two fire holes in all, that eat 2,000 tons of coal every trip across. Went thru the steward's and crew's quarters, which are not very good as to room and fresh air. Went to bow of ship from which wonderful sights can be seen. Went to the wheel-house and got chase out, but we saw how the ship is steered. Played in a deck tennis tournament with &quot;Doggie&quot; and lost. Saw a show called &quot;Tenderloin&quot; after dinner which was pretty good. Went to the bow and saw a most wonderful sight after dark. it is the phosphorous in the water at the bow. It is just like there is a big electric light shining thru the water. it is caused by sea animals which are phosphorescent. We could see them try to dart away from the ship because of their glow. It was just wonderful. Went to the First Class Masquerade Ball and saw some good costumes. We saw 3 ships during the day. a tanker, a four masted schooner and the three-stack Red Star liner, &quot;Belgeland&quot;. We also saw some porpoises in the afternoon. I guess I saw enough sights for one day. Turned in at 12:30 a.m.<br>
<br>
<b>Aug 2:</b> Got up at 8:00 a.m. The weather was pretty cold, so we weren't outside much. Saw a school of porpoises this morning, but no ships. It was foggy nearly all day. Watched the horse races in the smoking room 'til 11:30 p.m. Turned in at 11:45 p.m.<br>
<!--Page 3-->
<hr size="1" /><br>
<b>Aug 3:</b> Up at 8:00 a.m. Passed a freighter after breakfast. Went to the bow and took pictures of it and the Bridge. Had a haircut after lunch and bought my ring. Had a Tug-of-War with other men on two sides and won. Saw a Ladies Tug-of-War. Watched and was in a dandy Pillow-fight tournament (I lost) in which you sit on a pole and try to knock each other off. The last two to fight were nearly tied. One was called U.S.A. and the other Holland. U.S.A. won. Saw a good show in swhich Rin-Tin-Tin starred. It was the &quot;Land of the Wolves&quot;. Turned in at 11:00 p.m. in order to be up at 6:00 a.m. to see my first sight of land (the English coast) after seven days of travel at sea. Just saw lights of what seems to be three ships. Shows we are near a coast. They may have been light-houses or bouys.<br>
<br>
<b>Aug 4:</b> Up at 6:30 a.m. Saw the ship enter Plymouth Harbor and the Pilot get on and the ship-shore boat take passengers away. Took many picutres of this. After leaving Plymouth we saw about 50 ships until we arrived at Boulonge-Le-Mer and land nearly all the way. I had my first sight of land for eight days, this morning. Sea-gulls followed us all day. Arrived at Boulonge about 11:00 p.m. Saw many pretty sights today. Saw a few porpoises. Turned in at 12:35 p.m.<br>
<br>
<b>Aug 5:</b> Up at 11:00 a.m. Saw many ships. Saw the pilot board the ship before the Hook-of-Holland. Had a beautiful trip from there to Rotterdam. Saw many wonderful sights along this trip, scenery and ships, etc. Landed at the pier at 6:00p.m. Aunts Jo, Neeltje, Woutrien and Opa Kersbergen met us at the boat. We waited about an hour and a half for the car and then drove to Waddingsveen. Went to Uncle Leen Verstoep a while. Slept at Aunt Neeltje's tonite.<br>
<br>
<b>August 6:</b> Up at 9:00 a.m. Father and Mother came and got me and we went to Aunt Woutrien's and Opa Kersbergen and a Juffrow and drove to Sandvoort to my Aunt's summer home. Met her two little girls. They are both cute. Had a nice time on the beach of the North Sea. It was a little cold on the beach. Started for home about 5:00 p.m. The Juffrow who rode along became auto-sick because she couldn't stand it to ride in an automobile. Got along with my Dutch fairly well for the first day, but I had a lot to learn yet. Went to bed at Aunt Neeltje's at 10:00 p.m.<br>
<br>
<b>August 7:</b> Up at 9:30 a.m. Went riding in the afternoon to Aunt Jo's house and the &quot;Tweede Block&quot; and rode the bicycle to Great Grandmother's house in the morning. Was at Opoe's (Grandma's) while they opened the big trunk. Watched the small freight boats go up and down the Gouwa River and the draw bridge go up and down to let them thru. It is a nice sight to see. Had fun in a flat-bottomed boat with Wm. Ramp. He had a broken leg.<br>
<br>
<b>Aug. 8:</b> Went to the Gouda market this morning with uncle Dries. Had a dandy time. We rode to Gouda on our bicycles. Gouda is about five miles from Waddingsveen. Saw the different Jews, etc. (merchants) trying to sell their wares which run from teeth-extractors to umbrellas. Sat in a cafe in front of the market place and had a drink. Saw the old Stathuis (city hall). Went swimming in the Waddingsveen swimming pool. It is a pretty good affair. They have good high-diving boards and everything. The men all wear suits without shirts and they thought my suit was peculiar because it had a top.<br>
<br>
<b>August 9:</b> My Uncle Cor had a birthday today, so we had dinner at his house. Went and saw his nursery. Bought a fish line and went fishing in canal nearby but caught nothing.<br>
<!--Page 4-->
<hr size="1" /><br>
Had tea in the nursery, same as we have a picnic. Went back to Waddingsveen on a passenger boat from Boskoop. Went to Aunt Neeltje's and played with the girl cousins. The oldest is 12. Went rowing in an old affair that was supposed to be a row-boat, but we had a lot of fun. I sleep at Aunt Neeltje's all the time now and eat most of my meals here and I like the place because there is some life in it.<br>
<br>
<b>Aug. 10:</b> Went fishing some more but had no luck again. Have fun riding one of my Uncle's bikes around. Helped him deliver some groceries. Went swimming again after that. Saw a water-ball game. it is something like hockey only in the water and with a ball. When I came back I heard there had been a murder. That was quite something for a village like this and everyone knew about it within an hour. The murderer was brought to the county office and jail soon afterwards. In about 5 minutes the whole village was there to see him. There was a crowd around most of the night.<br>
<br>
<b>Aug. 11:</b> Went to the old Dutch church of my Grandmother this Sunday morning. You have to rent your seats (pews) for the year so i sat upstairs. Went for a walk after dinner with Oma. Everyone was talking about the murder wherever you went. It seems that a man (who happens to have the same last name and first initial as my uncle) killed another man by the name of Schotman with an old-fashioned razor because of a quarrel over a hedge that stood between their houses. Schotman's head was nearly cut off, and he was attacked from behind, in front of his house. He had been warned to look out. There was a mob at the County Building again all day today.<br>
<br>
<b>Aug. 12:</b> Didn't do much today. Went fishing without any luck and played around the village's main street and watched the sights go by, such as people and boats, etc. Ate supper at Opoe's house tonight. Had pancakes. Am catching up my Diary which i had let get a week behind. Have to write a few letters yet and then will go to bed. Mother and Father got Mrs. Buker, a family friend, off the boat yesterday and took her to Amsterdam. They slept at Opa Kersbergen's last night.<br>
<br>
<b>Aug. 13:</b> Up at 8:30 a.m. The murderer was taken to Rotterdam at 7:00 a.m. this morning to be tried. He won't get more than 15 years becuse they have no death or life sentences in Holland. Fixed an old bicycle for the kids next door. Took a picture of all the kids in the neighborhood. Will sell them for 10 cents.<br>
<br>
<b>Aug. 14:</b> Up at 9:00 a.m. Got the pictures back this noon and sold about ten of them. Learned how to put a farmer's wagon together because I first took it apart. We're going to Noordwijk tomorrow.<br>
<br>
<b>Aug. 15:</b> Got up at 7:30 a.m. (early?). Took a picture of a ship this morning and the skipper wants 6 of them for 10 cents each. Went to Noordwijk on a big bus which we had hired for the day, at 9:30 a.m. Rented six beach-chairs. Ate dinner. Went swimming in the North Sea (salt water and do I know it.) Went after sea shells later and got my pants soaked by a big wave. Had a dandy time. Went back in the bus at 6:30 p.m. Got to Waddingsveen at 8:30 p.m. Turned in at 10:00 p.m. (There were 21 persons in our party).<br>
<!--Page 5-->
<hr size="1" /><br>
<b>Aug 16:</b> Had fun with the kids next door. Didn't do much else today. Went for a walk with Toosie (14) who lives next door to Aunt Neeltje.<br>
<br>
<b>August 17:</b> Up at 8:00 a.m. Waited all morning for Mother and Father to come to go to Sandvoort. They came about 12:30 p.m. Had dinner here. We left about 1:30 p.m. and arrived in Sandvoort at 4:00 p.m. Took a wak thru the sand dunes and the town with Artje. Got Uncle Jack at the train. He is a doctor and has cured many people who were thought to be incurable. He is now helping Dad with his asthsma. Walked along the sea-shore in the wind in the evening.<br>
<br>
<b>Aug. 19:</b> Up at 8:30 a.m. Bought a pair of beach shoes and a kite. Went to the beach early in the morning. flew my kite and went wading in the ocean. stayed on the beach until the tide came in and surrounded the chairs with water in the trench we had dug. That was about 3:30 p.m. Ate dinner and started for Boskoop. First went to Grandma's. Played with a gang of kids from the neighborhood for a while. Then to Aunt Neeltje's and to bed.<br>
<br>
<b>Aug. 20:</b> Up at 7:00 a.m. At 8:00 Mother and Father came and we left for Arnheim with Aunt Neeltje and Uncle Dries. It was the first time Uncle Dries rode in our car and he liked it. At 10:00 we stopped at a lunch room and had our breakfast. Went thru Utrecht. Between Ede and Arnheim we rode on a real American cement road and dit it feel good! Arrived at Arnheim at 11:30 a.m. First, we went to a museum in which all reliques of the Dutch Indies War were kept, and the Soldiers Home. Saw all the old guns used in that time, canons, mortars, muskets, revolvers, etc. Also waw the spears, armour, etc. of the tribes of the Indies and of the people of China. Saw many other interesting things there. Next we went to an Estate of a Dutch Baron. A caretaker took a group of people thru free. The scenery was wonderful. We had to cross over a chain bridge and we had to run all the way to get over without slipping. We also walked around a fountain, but all at once about fifty smaller fountians started to spout around about us. Some people got all wet (A trick). Saw the Baron's castle and the exit used in time of war. Saw the wonderful shell gallery. It is a gallery in the side of a hill whose walls are all inlaid with wonderful shells. Went back to Arnheim and had dinner in a cafe. We then went to the Animal Park a little ways outside of Arnheim. The park alone was worth the trip to Arnheim. We saw many different and rare kinds of animals and birds, such as black and white storks, swan, parrots, buzzards, sea-ariends, vultures, wolves, wild boars monkeys, mountain goats and sheep who climbed up high rocks that were made for them, tigers, lions, leopards, camels (one only 7 months old), and an elephant and baboons. It was a dandy park and it was fun to see the different animals play together. We spent about an haur and half there. Started home at 7:00 p.m. Arrived at 10:00 p.m. Traveled about 250 kilometers or 150 miles. Forgot to say that near Ede we saw about 150 Dutch soldiers carrying on war practice, on the road, with all kinds of canons, tractor guns and everything just like a real war. One side were the Hollanders. The enemy had white bands around their hats to distinguish them. The privates had to salute every officer. Every once in a while a dispatcher on a motorcycle would fly past us. The soldiers moved from one place to another on foot, bicycles and in autos. Some of the soldiers were laying in the fields and everything was carried on like there was a real war. It was all very interesting to see.<br>
<br>
<b>Aug. 21:</b> Up at 10:00 a.m. The kids are all going to school, for their vacation was over on Tuesday (yesterday). They have only 4 weeks of vacation here. Helped Undle Dries deliver groceries this noon. Tried to fly my kite at Aunt Belia's, but there wasn't enough wind, so I played wome games with my cousins and others 'til 9:00 p.m.<br>
<!--Page 6-->
<hr size="1" /><br>
<b>Aug. 22:</b> It was raining this morning, so I wrote some letters and postcards. Mrs. Buker came from Amsterdam today. she took the bus to Boskoop where Father and Mother are staying. They arrived here just after she left, so they had to go back to Boskoop again. Turned in at 11:00 p.m.<br>
<br>
<b>Aug. 23:</b> Rained again today. Yesterday we had our first bad weather in Holland for this trip. Went to Rotterdam today to see about our stateroom for the trip back on the &quot;Statendam&quot;. On the way back we had a puncture in a rear tire (a nail). Took us about half and hour to change tires.<br>
<br>
<b>Aug 24:</b> Up at 8:30 a.m. Made a small sailing ship today by the people next-door. It really sails before the wind and nicely too. There was a good wind today, so i went and flew my kite on Uncle Leens's farm. It pulled quite hard. Went swimming at the pool right after that. The water was cold, but i had a good time diving, etc. Had a friendly evening with Tossie.<br>
<br>
<b>Aug 25:</b> Went to church this morning. After church a lot of the relation had dinner at Aunt Neeltje's where I board. This afternoon we went to Boskoop to get Uncle Bert who rode his bike all the way from Breda (60 miles) during the night. it rained on the last 15 miles of his trip to boot. He had received news that he could come to America, so he wanted to talk about it. All of the visitors stayed for supper, too.<br>
<br>
<b>Aug 26:</b> Up at 9:00 a.m. Put a rudder on my little sail-boat. Went for a ride in the row-boat of the skipper, whose ship is anchored near Uncle Dries store. Bought the skipper and his two helpers, who are loading flax, some beer. That's how I got the rides in the row-boat. Went rowing some more this afternoon and this evening. The skipper had his boat all loaded and was ready to sail this evening when one side of the load on the boat fell off. (The water level in the river went down and the boat hit bottom and tipped). He will have to remove and reload all those bundles of flax. Learned how to do my cross-puzzle and another one from the man who gave them to me.<br>
<br>
<b>Aug 27:</b> Up at 9:00 a.m. Went to Boskoop on the bike, about a 15 minute ride. Played my aunt Jo's phonograph. At noon, went to get my Uncle Cor from the nursery and to get some flowers. Ate dinner there and then came back to Waddingsveen. Uncle Adrian came to visit my Aunt tonight. He asked me to come to Boskoop tomorrow. Turned in at 10:30 p.m.<br>
<br>
<b>Aug 28:</b> Up at 8:00 a.m. Went and rented a bike after breakfast. Rode to Boskoop and Uncle Adrian's house. Went fishing in a canal back of the house. Caught one about 2 inches long (and lost it again). After dinner went sailing in a small boat in the canals and went fishing some more. Caught another. I was pushing the boat back and stepped in a hole along side the canal and got a wet foot. They say I'm now baptized a real Boskooper. Returned to Waddingsveen at 8:15 p.m. Paid only 50 cents to rent the bike for the whole day.<br>
<br>
<b>Aug 29:</b> Up at 8:30 a.m. Dad and Mother came at 9:30 a.m. Went and got Mr. &amp; Mrs. Van Spronsen near Rotterdam. We all went to Gouda. Walked thru the market in front of the City Hall. Bought a few things from the merchants (Jews). Went to the big church in which the world - reknowned Gouda window paintings are located. They are very beautiful in color. The painter is said to have been killed because he would not tell the mixture of the wonderful paint he used. it is not known to this day. The paintings in themselves are beautiful and wonderful. The depict stories and scenes from the Bible. They are all very realistic and the perspective is very good. The church was built in th 13th century and the paintings (glass windows) in the 15th century. The pictures were all explained to us by a man from the church. Because the church is so old, it is being restored. This has gone on for 40 years, but they are now nearly finished. Church is still held in the building and there is a beautiful organ in it. Stroop Puffertjes. Great! Turned in at 10:30.<br>
<br>
<b>Aug 30:</b> Up at 9:00 a.m. Wrote a letter to Evie Van Bree. It was very warm today,<br>
<br>

<br>
today. Have been having nice weather nearly every day. This evening I rented a row-boat from a ship-maker at 10 cents per hour. I had it for and hour and a half. Had a lot of fun. Took most of the children of the neighborhood for rides up and down the river.<br>
<br>
<b>Aug. 31:</b> Today was the Queen of Holland's birthday. Every city and town has a celebration. Waddingsveen has theirs next week Wednesday. Parade, fireworks and everything. This afternoon I took a ride in a Dutch (canoe) kayak. It is a long, narrow thing. One person can just squeeze in it. I put my bathing suit on for safety. It was very hard to balance and I went under three times, but I got the hang of it now. Went swimming this evening. Fine, because it was warm today. Took pictures of Mr. Lous today.<br>
<br>
<b>Sept. 1:</b> Got up at 10:30 a.m. because Mother and Father came last night and I didn't go to bed until 12:00 a.m. Today was Sunday but I couldn't go to church this morning. Had dinner at Aunt Belia's. Mother and Father, too. Had a lot of fun with the children this noon. Had supper there too. Met Mr. Lous this noon and he said that I could go along on a trip with his motor-scow (freight boat) tomorrow, for a three day and two night trip.<br>
<br>
<b>Sept. 2:</b> Up at 9:00 a.m. Got my stuff ready to take on the trip. We were scheduled to sail at 2:00 p.m. Helped load some furniture on board. Passed thru Boskoop and a few other small towns on the way. Went thru some locks and a new canal. About 8:00 p.m. we entered Amsterdam. Sailed thru the canals and saw many sights. I had brought only my supper along so I bought some eggs (10 cents each). At 9:00 p.m. we tied up at a wharf. Went for a stroll thru the main street and the slum district of Amsterdam with the skipper and the helper. Turned in at 11:00 p.m.<br>
<br>
<b>Sept. 3:</b> Got up at 7:30 a.m. to see the sights again. slept pretty good in one of the bunks in the cabin. Passed thru the shipping harbor of Amsterdam and saw many big ships. Unloaded some goods at Zaandam. Got off the boat at Zaandjke to go to a windmill musem, but it wasn't open yet. Took the train to the place where I was to meet the boat again. Zaandike is pretty because of all the big windmills that still stand there. Most all are still used. Bought my breakfast, and dinner and supper at Wormeveer. (Loaf of bread, 1/2 lb of butter, and a bottle of milk). There are many big factories in Wormeveer. We unloaded grain at a big grain mill. After dinner I took a bus back to the museum all about windmills. Very interesting. Met the boat at Zaandam at 6:00 p.m. From there we went to one of the biggest lumber yards in the Netherlands. There was a strike on, so on every tug boat there was a policeman. Tugboats were used instead of trucks to haul the lumber. slept there that night. Slept good too!<br>
<br>
<b>Sept. 4:</b> Up at 8:00 a.m. Went to a museum in the house where Czar Peter of Russia lived when he learned to be a ship maker in the Netherlands. It is very old and out of shape. At 10:00 a.m. we started for home. Passed thru Amsterdam again, but took a different route back. Passed over a big lake. It was very hot on deck that afternoon because there is no covering. At 6:30 p.m. we were back in Waddingsveen. There had been a celebration for the Queen's birthday. After cleaning myself up, went to the moving-picture and fireworks. Had a lot of fun with some of my friends. Saw a couple of drunken men, but they weren't arrested because beer is sold everywhere after the fireworks. We (Aunt and Uncle) sat up with the neighbors until 2:00 a.m. Then to bed.<br>
<br>
<b>Sept. 5:</b> Up at 11:00 a.m. Didn't do very much today. Talked with Toosie.<br>
<br>
<b>Sept. 6:</b> Up at 9:00 a.m. Took the boat to Boskoop at 11:00 a.m. Ate dinner at Aunt Jo's. After dinner went to the celebration of the Queen's birthday in Boskoop. Bought some fireworks. Had fun watching kids get soaked in the tub-poking contest. (Riding a cart down a short incline under a tub of water which tipped if rider missed the hole in the target). At night went to the fireworks with Mother, Father, Uncles Dries and Cor, and Aunts Neeltje and Jo. Had a lot of fun, but didn't see much of the fireworks. Went to a cafe with dancing where Mother went when she was young. Had a dandy time. to bed at 2:00 a.m.<br>
<br>
<b>Sept. 7:</b> Up at 10:00 a.m. At 1:30 p.m. started for Breda. Went thru Rotterdam and Dordretch and over the Dutch deep with the ferry. Saw the biggest bridge in the Netherlands. A long one too. Saw many sights along the road. Got into Breda at 5:00 p.m. My Uncle Bert lives in a small portplace. It is all very old. Breda is a beautiful old city with many old fort and churches. We took a walk thru the business district and it was very busy because it was Saturday evening.<br>
<br>
<b>Sept 8:</b> Up at 9:30 a.m. Mother went to the Salvation Army meeting with my Aunt. In the afternoon we went to the Catholic Park in Belgium with our auto. The park was just over the border, but Hollanders are allowed to go there without passports. The park was very beautiful and there were many life-size statutes of Christ's walk to the Cross and the Crucifixion. We were in Belguim, so we could use Belguim money. For 35 cents Dutch money I got 12 peices of Belfium money which amounted to 5 Francs. Later, I watched my Uncle develope some of my pictures.<br>
<br>
<b>Sept 9:</b> Up at 9:00 a.m. Went and took a couple of pictures in the town. At 11:00 a.m. we started for home again. Ate dinner in a swell dafe in Rotterdam at 3:00 p.m. I was supposed to go to Den Hague, but I said I would rather go home (Waddingsveen). When we got there, I found out it was planned for next week, so everything was all right again. I was to go because the Queen was going to ride in her gold coach.<br>
<br>
<b>Sept 10:</b> Tomorrow is my birthday, so I stayed around the bridge at Waddingsveen today. Didn't have much to do. Made an airplane for Arie VandeWater.<br>

<b>Sept. 11:</b> (Birthday): Up at 9:00 a.m. My Grandfather Kersbergen had come all the way from Boskoop on his bike and he was here before I got up. He came upstairs and he gave me a note for 25 Guilders and said it was my birthday present. It amounted to $10 in American money, but it is a fortune over here, and to me too. He said I could buy anything I wanted to for it, to take along to America. When I came down stairs, my Aunt gave me a little box with a beautiful gold ring with a sparkling stone in it. It was from the whole Heyns family together and it was very beautiful. At 11:00 a.m. I took the boat to Boskoop with Mother and Father. Went to my Uncle's house for coffee time. Stayed there until after dinner. My Uncle gave me a dandy magnifying glass because I liked one so. From there we started back to Waddingsveen. Stopped at my Aunt Trj's house and asked her to come to the party. About 7:00 p.m. I began to bring the people to the bridge with the auto. (The bridge is the place where my Aunt Neeltje lives). I got a pencil outfit for the desk from Mother. It made so that the pencil is always handy and can never get lost. Got a birthday book from Aunt Coba; the book Ben Hur from cousin Dit Verwy. It was written in Dutch, but she was going to try and get an English publication. Got a souvineer drinking glass from the neighbor lady of my Grandmother Heyns. There were 26 guests in all and we had a dandy time with drinks on the table and tarts to eat. I took two flash pictures of the whole group. I hope they turn out good. Everybody had such a good time that they didn't start home until 12:00 a.m. and that's very late for the farmers around here. Some of them were a little tipsy when they went home, but everything went fine. My great grandmother was at the party too. She is 94, but had as much fun as anyone. I'll say I had a dandy birthday here in Holland. Turned in at 1:00 a.m.<br>
<br>
<b>Sept 12:</b> Up at 10:00 a.m. Mother and Father came after me and I drove to Amsterdam to my Aunt's house. That evening we took a walk thru the city and saw the sights.<br>
<br>
<b>Sept. 13:</b> This afternoon my Father, Grandfather and I took a trip to Marken and Volendam. We had to go by steam-tram and then by boat. I left my Kodak on the steam-tram and had to call the next station to have them hold it there; but the worst of it was, that I couldn't take any pictures of the people in Marken. The people of Marken are just like you see them on pictures. The children wear the same kind of clothes as the old people, but the small boys have long hair, the same as the girls. It was all very interesting. Marken is an island and sometimes it gets flooded, so all the houses and building are built on poles. The people all have wooden shoes on. The women wear long dresses and the men, pants with very wide pant legs. The clothes are all highly colored. In Volendam the dress is nearly the same, but not so colorful. When we were there the men, mostly all fishermen, were thru with work. They all sat on the street in groups and talked together. The street was nearly flooded with tobacco juice in front of them. We got home at 7:30 p.m.<br>
<br>
<b>Sept. 14:</b> (Amsterdam) Didn't do much in the morning. In the afternon, I took cousin Trien's bicycle and went for a ride thru a big park nearby and on some of the main streets. It sure was busy. While I was in Amsterdam, I saw what is left of Old Amsterdam. This is in the very heart of the city, but it is all surrounded by buildings. You enter it thru a small archway. When you are inside, it is like a dream because it is so quiet in there. Very impressing. After supper we went to the movie<br>
<br>

<br>
&quot;Show Boat&quot; which was playing for the first time in Amsterdam. It was a talking film made in America, so all the talking was in English. It seemed good to hear real English again. made in America, all the talking was in English. It seemed goood to hear real English again.<br>
<br>
<b>Sept. 15:</b> This afternoon we went for a ride. We planned to go to Volendam so that I could take pictures. First we went to see what will be the biggest locks for ships, in the world. It is 100 meters long, about 50 meters longer than the Panama locks. It is 27 meters deep - nearly 90 feet. Its a very big job and will take 10 years to finish it. We then started for Volendam, but on the way the car stopped because a gas line got plugged. After waiting about two hours, in which time we found out we had a flat tire and changed it, a garage man came. After he said he had it fixed, we drove on for 15 minutes when she stopped again. We got the same man to fix it again, but it was getting dark so he took the car to his garage and we went to Amsterdam by bus. He said he would bring the car the next day. The worst of it was that I couldn't take pictures again. We got home at 9:30 p.m.<br>
<br>
<b>Sept. 16:</b> Went and got the children from the private school with my Aunt Woutrien. After dinner, I told them all Goodbye, because I would not see them again before I went back to America. Walked down to one of the main squares of Amsterdam where the office of the Royal Dutch Airlines is located. Bought my ticket for Rotterdam for 7.50 Guilders or about $3.00. Had to wait about 15 minutes for the bus, which was to take the other passengers and I to the flying field. This was a regular service, not a pleasure service. It is about a 20 minute ride. In the bus I was a little nervous, thinking about the trip, but as soon as I got to the flying field, I felt all right again. We all stepped into the passenger compartment. There were seats for 12 and there were eleven passengers. Before we got in, everyone was given a piece of cotton-batting to put in their ears. After the motors (2) were warmed up, we started off. It sounded just like two big trucks pulling up hill, but it didn't feel much worse than going up in a fast elevator. When we got up we seemed to be going about 10 miles an hour. The cows grazing on the land below looked like flies on pieces of green paper. We went over a couple of lakes and the sailboats looked like toys. The windmills were very small, too. Rotterdam was a toy city with specks for people. The &quot;Statendam&quot; was a big toy boat, that lay in a tiny creek. It was all wonderful, but there was nothing exciting about the flying itself. When we came down for the landing you could see for the first time that we were going fast. Took a few pictures after I got out, then started for Waddingsveen. I had to go all the way thru Rotterdam to get to the bus. It was a nice ride on the street cars and I got there allright by using my tongue, because I was all alone. The flying time from Amsterdam to Rotterdam was 25 minutes. An auto takes two hours to do it. Got in Waddingsveen about 7:30 p.m., before Mother and Father. Sept. 16 Had to tell Toosie all about it.<br>
<br>
<b>Sept. 17:</b> Didn't do anything unusual today.<br>
<br>
<b>Sept. 18:</b> Slowly on we are beginning to say Goodbye to our relatives, because we leave next week Thursday.<br>
<br>
<b>Sept. 19:</b> Went to Den Hague today. We were going to visit relatives of the Van Soets, but Mother forgot her address book and she didn't know the address. We went to the beach at Schevenigen today. Saw a couple of fishing boats leave the harbor., with all the wives, mothers and sweethearts telling &quot;Goodbye&quot; until they couldn't be seen anymore.<br>
<br>
<b>Sept. 20 &amp; 21:</b> More Goodbyes.<br>
<br>
<b>Sept. 22:</b> Went to church for the last time in Holland, this morning.<br>
<br>
<b>Sept. 23:</b> Went to Den Hague again today. Visited<br>
the museum &quot;Mesdag&quot;. In it is the most wonderful panorama I ever saw. Everything is life-like on the painting because of the way the light falls on it. Went to a big department store and bought a shaving outfit for half the money my Grandfather gave me for my birthday.<br>
<br>
<b>Sept. 24:</b> My Aunt Neeltje's birthday. Said more &quot;Goodbyes&quot;.<br>
<br>
<b>Sept. 25:</b> Took pictures and exchanged addresses with my Dutch friends. We are going to write each other. There was a wreck on the Gouwa River tonight. A drunken skipper ran into another boat. The police came and put them in jail for the night. You are allowed to drink over here, but you may not be drunken. Went to bed at 11:30 p.m. for the last time in Netherlands.<br>
<br>
<b>Sept. 26:</b> Up at 9:00 a.m. Rented a bike and rode to Boskoop to say &quot;Goodby&quot; some more. Told the VandeWaters &quot;Goodbye&quot; this noon. Little Kaasie wanted to go along with me. Took the bus with my mother and 8 relatives to Rotterdam. My dad had gone this morning to get the car on board the ship. We all went on board and took a look around the big, new ship. They all liked it. At 7:20 p.m. we started to sail for America after saying &quot;Goodbye&quot; many times to all my good friends in Holland. Stayed up until we passe the &quot;Hook of Holland&quot;.<br>
<br>

<br>
<b>Sept. 27:</b> We were in Boulonge, France this morning when I got up. Stayed ther until after noon loading autos and passengers. Sailed past the beautiful dliffs of Dover and anchored at Southhampton; waited about two hours for passengers.<br>
<br>
<b>Sept. 28:</b> Had our last sight of land for a few days, this morning. The sea is quite rough and the ship rocks some too. There is a strong wind and it is cold and cloudy. Went up to the bow this evening. It is quite a ways walking because the ship is so big. Took a salt-water bath tonight, the first real bath since I have been in Holland.<br>
<br>
<b>Sept. 29:</b> The weather and sea is a little worse today. There are quite a few seasick and I don't feel like a million dollars either. The &quot;Leviathan&quot; passed us going East. Went up to the bow again today and took a few pictures. Climbed up to the Crow's Nest by a little ladder which is inside the forward mast. It was a long climb because the crow's nest is high on the mast. A seaman lookout was there. He let me look around, but warned me to stay in front of the mast so I would not be seen by the officers on the bridge. As the ship rolled, the mast and Crow's Nest would swing back and forth - quite a thrill!<br>
<br>
<b>Sept. 30:</b> Up at 8:00 a.m. We have luncheon at 1:15 p.m. and dinner at 7:00 p.m. everyday because they have to serve two &quot;tables&quot; and we are on the second. A Cunnard liner passed us this noon, going west. I think it was the &quot;Berengaria&quot;. It passed real close and we could see everything on the ship very plain. It was a wonderful sight to see the big ship roll in the ocean the same as we were doing. Went to the movie tonight - &quot;Women They Talk About&quot;. It was pretty good. We gain about 45 minutes every night so we get enough sleep and must reset our watches.<br>
<br>
<b>Oct. 1:</b> Played shuffle board and deck tennis. The weather was pretty good today and the ocean swells were less. Watched the horse races (make-believe) on 2nd Class this noon. We are Tourist Class.<br>
<br>
<b>Oct. 2:</b> Up at 7:30 a.m. It was misty most all day, but the wind and sea were calm. Had the Horse races on Tourist Class deck today. I won a few stakes of 75 cents each. Saw a lot of three-masted fishing schooners, so we must be just off the banks of New Foundland. It won't be long now before we make port. It is cold this evening because we are a long ways north. Saw a big school of porpoises close by the ship and saw a liner headed east also.<br>
<br>
<b>Oct. 3:</b> Again played shuffle board, and took pictures. Had another Horse race this noon on Second Class, but didn't win anything. About 2:30 p.m. we ran into a storm. The wind was so strong that if I opened my coat, I could slide on the wet deck at a good speed. The waves got so high that a few sprayed over the lower deck and water ran towards the stern. So we had a little taste of a storm after all. Went to a movie - &quot;Stolen Kisses&quot; at 9:00 p.m.<br>
<br>
<b>Oct. 4:</b> Up at 7:30 a.m. Went to the bow this morning to see the waves spray over the front deck. Got pretty wet while I watched because the waves sprayed me too. The wind was so strong that we could hardly stand up. Went and took a look at the First Class swimming pool and gym this noon. The pool is beautifully finished in green tile, although it is quite small. The gym is very well equipped. It has two electric horses. I rode, and I could hear my bones rattle at full speed. Passed Nantucket Light Ship at 8:45 p.m., so we'll get into New York tomorrow. Didn't get to bed until 12:00 a.m. because we all had a wort of &quot;Farewell&quot; party in the Bar Room. Had a lot of fun with singing and drinking (non-alcholic for me) because it was the last night aboard ship.<br>
<br>
<b>Oct. 5:</b> Up at 6:00 a.m. because breakfast was to be served at 6:30 a.m. At 7:00 a.m. we had our first sight of land. At 8:30 we stopped at Quarentine to take the inspectors and doctors on board. Then we proceeded to New York harbor. It was a wonderful sight when we entered the harbor with the Statue of Liberty on the left and the tall buildings of New York City on the right, the Woolworth Building standing above the rest. Then further on all the big docks with some of the world's largest ocean liners berthed there. We docked at 11:00 a.m. At 11:30 a.m. the &quot;New Amsterdam&quot; liner started its trip to Holland again. We saw it back out of the pier, with tugs. Just at that time 5 other ocean liners started for Europe so you can see it was a most beautiful and wonderful sight - to see all the large liners sail majestically down the Hudson River with numerous small boats and tugs surrounding them and with New York City in the background. At 11:45 a.m. we got off the ship, but we had to wait until about 3:00 to have our baggage checked over by customs officials and to have our car unloaded. The dock was swarming with all kinds of people, so we couldn't hurry if we wanted to. After that we ate dinner in a restaurant where they served beer by the meals just as if it was a common affair and that was in the middle of Hoboken too. (1929 - Prohibition was in effect.) We said Goodbye to Cor Ouddyk who had met us at the dock and then started driving towards home. We were soon in the mountains again. We passed over one mountain that was 1,003 feet above sea level and we had just come from sea level in Hoboken, so we did some climbing. The sun was just going down over the mountains and it was a most wonderful sight. We stayed in the Washington House, Stroudsburg, Pa. Took a walk thru town before going to bed.<br>
<br>
<b>Oct 6:</b> Up at 7:00 a.m. Drove 'til 9:00 a.m. and had a fan belt fixed on the car because they had not put it on straight in Holland. After breadfast, drove thru the mountains all day. Saw some wonderful scenery. Once we saw a train go along the face of a mountain, while we were on top. It looked small but it was very long. Drove all day until 9:30 p.m. - then stopped at the Eagle Hotel in a little town outside of Erie, Pa.<br>
<br>
<b>Oct 7:</b> Had breakfast at 7:00 a.m. Drove thru Erie and Cleveland. Nothing interesting was to be seen on this part of the trip. At 8:30 p.m. we arrived in Grand Rapids and at 9:00 p.m. I stepped into my own home again and it seemed good, too! So this is the end of my trip to Europe and the most wonderful time of my life. Saw 4 foreign countries, 5 states of America and traveled 10,000 miles in 2 1/2 months of travel, 2,000 by auto and 8,000 by boat.<br>
